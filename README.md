# olang-interpreter
[!note] this language is way underdeveloped, pls do not use it in production if you dont want be fucked
interpreter for olang (o programming language)

# what is olang?
olang means optmized programming language, designed be balanced and as result, its code (no your code, it sucks) optimized / clean
also olang uses stack (its own stack not computer's stack) with contains pointers of value, designed be simple and since use stack it will cover all, and since dont use computer's stack it means it can be allocated just fine

# why the fuck olang?
supposed be swiss knife, on future will have compiler, but for now its interpreter, so yeah

# status
- PRE-INDEV(current): way early, prototypes still, desgin mainly, dreams only
- INDEV: syntax being formed, somewhat defing result
- PRE-ALPHA: before the first major release
- ALPHA: released, still early, std libarry needs be done and should have some
- BETA: growing community, package manager, language grows, maybe compiler
- FIRE: now its done, the compiler also should be done here, and also cross platform and mvoing away from python
